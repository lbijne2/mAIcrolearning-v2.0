          "theory": "A DNA nucleotide consists of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine). Ribose sugar is found in RNA nucleotides, not DNA."

      "choices": ["Neutrophil", "Erythrocyte", "Lymphocyte", "Monocyte"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "theory": "White blood cells (leukocytes) are immune cells such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Erythrocytes are red blood cells that carry oxygen and are not part of the immune system."

      "question": "What is the main function of the spleen?",
      "choices": ["To produce bile", "To filter blood", "To regulate body temperature", "To store urine"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "theory": "The spleen filters the blood, removes old or damaged red blood cells, and helps mount immune responses by housing lymphoid tissue that encounters antigens."

      "question": "Which vitamin deficiency leads to scurvy?",
      "choices": ["Vitamin A", "Vitamin B12", "Vitamin C", "Vitamin D"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "theory": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is needed for collagen synthesis and antioxidant defense. Deficiency impairs connective tissue and causes scurvy with symptoms like gum bleeding and poor wound healing."

      "choices": ["Tricuspid valve", "Pulmonary valve", "Mitral valve", "Aortic valve"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "theory": "The mitral (bicuspid) valve sits between the left atrium and left ventricle and has two leaflets. The tricuspid valve is between the right atrium and right ventricle."

      "choices": ["Staphylococcus aureus", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Streptococcus pneumoniae", "Escherichia coli"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "theory": "Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an acid-fast bacillus transmitted by respiratory droplets. It often involves the lungs and can form caseating granulomas."

      "question": "What is the primary neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction?",
      "choices": ["Dopamine", "Serotonin", "Acetylcholine", "GABA"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "theory": "At the neuromuscular junction, motor neurons release acetylcholine, which binds nicotinic receptors on skeletal muscle to trigger contraction."

      "id": "med8",
      "question": "Which hormone is produced by the adrenal medulla?",
      "choices": ["Cortisol", "Aldosterone", "Epinephrine", "Thyroxine"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "theory": "The adrenal medulla secretes catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) in response to sympathetic stimulation. The adrenal cortex makes cortisol and aldosterone."

      "choices": ["MRI", "Ultrasound", "CT scan", "Echocardiography"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "theory": "CT scans use X‑rays (ionizing radiation) to produce cross‑sectional images. MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves; ultrasound uses high‑frequency sound; echocardiography is a cardiac ultrasound."

      "choices": ["High ferritin", "Low TIBC", "Low serum iron", "Macrocytosis"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "theory": "Iron‑deficiency anemia typically shows low serum iron, high TIBC, low ferritin, and microcytosis (small red cells)."

      "question": "What is the first‑line treatment for anaphylaxis?",
      "choices": ["Antihistamines", "Corticosteroids", "Albuterol", "Intramuscular epinephrine"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "theory": "Anaphylaxis is a life‑threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate intramuscular epinephrine to reverse airway edema, hypotension, and bronchospasm. Supportive measures follow."
